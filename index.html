				<p class="lead">Hi! I’m Sean Clark, and I am a local resident to the Northern Virginia/DMV area! I was born in Fairfax, VA, and I have lived nearly my whole life in McLean, VA. Personally, I have no experience in coding, but I do thoroughly enjoy repairing and fixing cars and mobile phones. My experiences are always self-taught (mostly through necessity), and I crave the ability to perfect my practices.</p>
				<p class="lead">I currently am a student over at George Mason University, where I am studying Criminology, but I have now placed my degree on hold to pursue becoming full-stack web developer, in the hopes of combining both fields to acquire a job in the future. Who knows, maybe becoming a web developer will take me into an entirely different major, and allow me to return and use the skills I am learning to my advantage in my academic career.</p>
				<p class="lead">There is quite a lot more to who I am as a person, and please, don’t hesitate to use the “Contact” link found in the top of this page to reach out and ask me anything! Thanks and have a great day!</p>
